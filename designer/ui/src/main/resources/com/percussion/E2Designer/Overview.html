<BODY>
   This document describes the classes defined by the E2 designer. The designer
   is a tool for visually creating E2 applications. <p>
   
   The designer is composed of 2 packages, E2Designer and browser. The
   E2Designer encompasses all the classes and functionality in the program
   except for the object browser window, including the main frame and visual
   design windows. The browser is a window containing tabs for each driver
   supported by E2. Each tab contains a tree with a hierarchical representation
   of the objects available from that driver. <p>
   
   For more information on the designer and browser, review the
   package summaries listed above.
