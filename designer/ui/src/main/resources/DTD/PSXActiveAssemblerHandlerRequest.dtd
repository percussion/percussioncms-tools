   XML documents conforming to this DTD will be sent to the Active Assembly 
   Handler. The first locator defines the current owner of the relationships 
   to be processed. The dependent set provides a list of locators and 
   properties to be processed. The second locator is optional and specifies 
   the target for operations like 'move'.
   
   type - the relationship type to use, must be a type with category 
      'rs_activeassembly'. Defaults to 'Related Content' if not supplied.
   
   index - the index used for the requested operation. This makes only sense
      for 'insert' and 'reorder' requests. Not supplied or set to -1 if not
      used.
