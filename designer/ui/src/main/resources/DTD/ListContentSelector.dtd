   This DTD describes a content list as used by list content 
   selectors of the Rhythmyx Content Loader. The idea is to have
   a crawler producing this list and dumping the results into an
   XML file of this format. Our selector will tehn read the list 
   and walk all servers, roots and links to fetch the content 
   found by the crawler.
   
   name - the name of this list content selector.
