   A content editor is an Item and a set of command handlers that allow the
   user to operate upon that item. The actual definition of the command
   handlers is done elsewhere.

   Attributes:
   id - An identifier for this object within the document. The actual value
         is not important as it is not used at this point.

   contentType - A numeric identifier that uniquely identifies the type of
         content this editor works with.

   workflowId - The numeric identifier of the workflow into which new content
         items will be sent after they are created. This is the default
         workflow if one is not specified the first time the content item is
         submitted.

   enableRelatedContent - This boolean specifies whether or not this content
      editor has related content enabled. The flag is optional and defaults to
      'no' if not provided.

   objectType - This is an integer that specifies the type of 'content' being
         generated by this editor. The allowed values come from the OBJECTS
         table. It is an optional attribute that defaults to 1 (item).
         Values other than 1 are reserved for system use.
