   name - the relationship name, must be unique accross all relationships

   label - the reltionship label as used in user interfaces. This can be
      translated.
      
   category - the category of this relationship, optional. Categories can be used to 
      group several relationship types together by a unique name, e.g.
      rs_activeassembly is used to group all Active Assembly relationships
      together.
      
   type - the relationship type is either 'system' or 'user'. 'system'
      relationships cannot be deleted by the user.
