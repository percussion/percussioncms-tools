   This DTD defines the stucture of the result XML document generated in the
   case of item validation error(s).

   If item validation fails, an error document conforming to this DTD will be
   created to the internal error cache. The client will be redirected to this
   document. It is the stylesheets responsibility to render the error 
   information in this document appropriately. We recommend an output structure
   similar to this:

      Screen url 1
         Error field(s) : error message 1
         Error field(s) : error message 2
      Screen url 2
         Error field(s) : error message 3
         Error field(s) : error message 4
      ...

   This way the user has information about all offending fields and the 
   appropriate link how to get there and correct it.
