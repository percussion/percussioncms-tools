   No dynamic internationalization of strings will be supported in this
   version. User strings are entered directly into the definition file.
   For each field used in UIDef, there must be a mapping in FieldMapper. Most
   of the optional properties of FieldSet will be ignored if they are present.

   See ContentEditorSystemDef.xml for a sample system config file.

   Provides hooks into the content editor system. One of the key purposes of
   this mechanism is to re-use existing workflow exits to save work on the
   implementation. You can specify the pre-processing and result document
   exits for each handler. Each handler should only be specified once.
   Additional definitions will be silently ignored.

   Attributes:
   commandName - must match the internal name of one of the command handlers.

   Allows the user to override default html parameter names used for various
   purposes. The internal name of the param is the name attribute of Param and
   the user specified value is the content. The following names are currently
   supported.

   commandParamName - The HTML parameter name that will be used by the
      server when selecting the command handler. If not specified,
      'sys_command' will be assumed.

   cacheIdParamName - The HTML parameter name that will be used by the
      server when retrieving a previously cached document. If not specified,
      'sys_cacheid' will be assumed.

   contentIdParamName - The HTML parameter name that will be used by the
      server when specifying the content id part of the content item key. If
      not specified, 'sys_contentid' will be assumed.

   revisionIdParamName - The HTML parameter name that will be used by the
      server when specifying the revision part of the content item key. If not
      specified, 'sys_revision' will be assumed.

   childIdParamName - The HTML parameter name that will be used by the
      server when specifying the id of the active child on the current
      request. If not specified, 'sys_childid' will be assumed. Children are
      assigned ids starting at 1 in document order within the def file.

<!--
   This mechanism allows name/value pairs to be passed into a command handler.
   All of them are loaded and made available from the system def object. A
   set of params may be made available to more than 1 command handler by
   specifying multiple CommandName elements.
