   NativeLibs element may have one or more NativeLib, which are grouped by the OS.
   The "os" attribute must be set to one of the following: "win", "unix", "solaris" or "linux".
   The "os" attribute can also contain a comma separated list of os keywords, for
   example: os="solaris, linux".
   The libraries are loaded in the exact order as they are provisioned for a given os.

<!--
   Each NativeLib has two attributes that define a single library properties for the loader,
   such as name and location. The location attribute determines what method should
   be used to load the library; there are two methods of loading native libraries in java:

   1. Using System.load that requires a full file path, this method requires "location"
       attribute to point to either a directory relative to the Rx root, ie: "bin" or a more
       precise location such as /usr/local/lib. There must be no trailing slash.

       For this method to work the library name should be an exact match to the files
       actual library file name, for example "libMyObj.so will be set as "libMyObj.so";
   
   2. Using System.loadLibrary which relies on the OS path to locate and load the library
       based on the SHORT library name, for example "libMyObj.so will be set as "MyObj";
      see javadoc for more details. For this method to work the "location" attribute has to
      be either missing or set to an empty string.
