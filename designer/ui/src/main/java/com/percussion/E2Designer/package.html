<p>The E2Designer is a program that allows a designer to create applications visually. The
first thing we need to do is look at the overall system so we can see how it all fits
together. The Framework is the main program that ties everything together, but doesn't
provide any useful information to the designer. There are 3 key components that provide
content interesting to the designer: the Process view, Pipe view and Browser. Each of
these objects is a container for other objects that actually do the work. A representation
of these objects is shown in the following picture. Every box in this figure represents an
object that will be implemented as a class. Let's look at each of them in turn.</p>

<p>Framework</p>
</b></i></font>

<p>The framework is the main frame window for the program. It contains the process views
and pipe views as child windows in a JDesktopPane window. Swing supports the concept of
MDI via the JInternalFrame object.</p>

<p>The main menu is defined at compile time except for the Insert menu, which includes a
list of objects that can be inserted into a view. To make it easier to add objects in the
future, the dropdown menu for this item will be created dynamically by querying the
currently active window to see if it has anything to insert. If no items are available,
and the main menu item doesn't have any items by default, the main menu item will be
removed from the main menu while this window is active. </p>

<p>The class hierarchy diagram showing the main frame, views and related diagrams is shown
in the following picture.</p>

<p>Process and Pipe Views</p>
</b></i></font>

<p>Both views in this application are visual editors. The process view is an editor for
the application while the pipe view is an editor for the dataset object. </p>

<p>On initial inspection, it may be thought that each view and the objects associated with
that view vary enough that different classes would be called for. However, after reviewing
the properties for each one, it became apparent that they are fundamentally the same.
Thus, a common base class will be created for both views. </p>

<p>Both editors have the same basic operations: 

<ul>
  <li>Inserting and removing objects </li>
  <li>Selection operations, including drag box selection </li>
  <li>Editing: cut, copy and paste </li>
  <li>Drag and drop, including custom drop actions </li>
  <li>Connecting 2 figures </li>
  <li>Allowing custom intra-window drag operations (for example to support resizing)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these operations can be supported for any object in either window. </p>

<p>Many different objects are displayed and edited in either view, but the frame has no
specific knowledge about any object. To support this capability, a figure factory will be
created that knows about all the objects that a certain type of view supports. This
factory will be obtained by the base class via an abstract protected call,
getFigureFactory(). The derived class will return the appropriate factory for the view
instance. </p>

<p>Since a figure factory is required for each view, a common base class was created to
create an interface for the factories. Then the derived instance of each factory will have
the information specific to that factory. Since only a single instance of a particular
factory is ever needed, to conserve memory only a single instance is created (singleton
pattern). This is implemented by creating a figure factory that creates the first instance
and caches it for each successive request. Again, the singleton pattern is appropriate for
the factory manager and is enforced by a static method in the manager that returns the
single instance (creating it the first time).</p>
<font FACE="Arial"><i><b>

<p>UIObjects</p>
</b></i></font>

<p>All objects appearing on the screen will be represented by an image (GIF file) by
default. (To customize appearance, the custom object would need to derive from the base
object.) They will have an associated data object and an editor for modifying the data.
The data and the editor will be treated polymorphically. The creator of this object is
responsible for supplying a data object and editor that are compatible.</p>

<p>Initially, each object will display a single image when it is attached to another
object and a possibly different image when it is not attached. This could be extended in a
future version to support images that are dependent on the state of the data.</p>

<p>If we look at all the objects in any of the views (except the connector), they are the
same except for 4 traits: 

<ul>
  <li>Object name </li>
  <li>Associated data object </li>
  <li>The editor for the data object </li>
  <li>Bitmap image(s) used for display of the object</li>
</ul>

<p>This implies a common base class can be used for all of the objects. As we did in PWB,
we could have derived a separate class for each of the desired objects, but I thought it
more efficient if we created a factory that knew how to create each object by maintaining
a table that stored the varying information for all of the objects (a different factory
will be used for each view). The figure class would store the data and its editor in each
of their base class forms. The class hierarchy diagram is shown in the following picture.</p>

</table>

<p>Objects will maintain a Selected property, which will be used by the containing frame
to manage user selection operations.</p>

<p>To support selective connectivity between objects, a UIConnectionPoint class will be
created. A figure can have 0 or more connection points. Each connection point is visible
to the end user to indicate an attachment point. Unlike PWB, when another figure is
attached, no connection point is created in the attaching figure, it just maintains a list
of the connection points that it is attached to.</p>

<p>To minimize resource usage, a bitmap manager will be designed. All objects will load
their bitmaps through this manager, thus allowing sharing of bitmaps. The bitmap manager
will maintain a reference to each loaded bitmap and will return that reference when the
image is requested. If needed, we could add a timeout to the cache.</p>

<p>E2 Server Proxy </p>

<p>The server proxy is implemented by using local copies of various classes that are
provided by the server.&nbsp;These include the com.percussion.design.objectstore and
com.percussion.design.catalog packages.</p>
