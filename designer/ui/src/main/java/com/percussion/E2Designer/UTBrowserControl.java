            We used to use rundll32 to execute url.dll:FileProtocolHandler.
            Unfortunately, we found out that this doesn't work properly in
            all versions of shell32.dll. So I created a dll that had an
            interface for rundll32 to call and called ShellExecute, which
            would accomplish the same thing, but was documented. As part of
            this change, I moved the command line to launch the browser from
            being hard-coded in this file to the designer.properties file.
            This will allow us to add an interface to allow the user to change
            it if they desire (esp. for unix). */
