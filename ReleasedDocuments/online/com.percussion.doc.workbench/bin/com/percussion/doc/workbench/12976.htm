<h1 class="heading1">About the Rhythmyx Workbench</h1>
<p class="bodytext">The Rhythmyx Workbench provides an environment for creating and arranging the majority of the components in your Rhythmyx system, including objects used for content creation, content assembly, user interface design, and Community and Role definition. For users who are upgrading from versions of Rhythmyx prior to 6.0, the Rhythmyx Workbench includes the ability to create applications, screen components, and other pre-6.0 features.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Beginning with Version 6.0, the Rhythmyx Workbench runs as a plug-in to the Eclipse environment. Eclipse is an open source development environment that runs in various environments and is extensible through plug-ins. If you are already an Eclipse user, you may have chosen to run the Rhythmyx Workbench as a plug-in to your existing Eclipse configuration.  If you are not a previous Eclipse user, although the Rhythmyx Workbench is running as an Eclipse plug-in, you probably only see the Rhythmyx Workbench:</p>

<div id="d13944" class="widegraphic" style="display:none"><p class="bodytext"><img src="rhythmyxwb.gif" alt="Rhythmyx Workbench" height="513" width="745" vspace="2" hspace="2" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
</div><p class="bodytext">Even if you only see the Rhythmyx Workbench interface, various Eclipse features and functions as well as the Eclipse online help are available to you. Since Eclipse refers to its desktop development environment as the Workbench, in the Rhythmyx online and printed documentation, we always refer to our interface as the <em class="emphasis">Rhythmyx</em> Workbench to avoid confusion. The Rhythmyx Workbench Help appears as a section in the existing Eclipse online Help. Read the following Eclipse topics prior to reading the Rhythmyx Workbench Help to understand these Eclipse terms which are used in the Rhythmyx Workbench Help:</p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet">Perspective xx link xx</li><li class="listbullet">Editor xxlinkxx</li><li class="listbullet">External Editor xxlinkxx</li><li class="listbullet">Views xxlinkxx</li></ul><p class="bodytext">The Rhythmyx Workbench Menu bar includes Eclipse menus. For general information about the functions on these menus, see the topics describing them in the Eclipse online help. In this Help, menu options are mentioned when they are part of the procedure for opening a Rhythmyx window or configuring a Rhythmyx setting. </p>
