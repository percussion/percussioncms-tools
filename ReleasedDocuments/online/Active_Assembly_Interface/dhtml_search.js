During Active Assembly, you can also edit content items if you want to change specific pieces of information that are appearing.","The formats that you can apply to a content item are called Templates. Templates are defined in your system and either format a content item as a page or a chunk of data that can become part of a page. Formatted items that can only become part of a page are called Snippets.","In the following graphic, the About Enterprise Investments content item is formatted using a Page Template. The formatted item can stand alone as a page on a Site.","In the next graphic, the same item is formatted using a Snippet Template.  The item cannot stand alone as a page on a Site.  It can only be included as part of a page.","You may have noticed that the two formats of the same item contain different information.  This is because:","A Template can include different pieces of data (fields) from a content item;","A Template can include Slots, or placeholders for other formatted content items.","The following diagrams of the two Templates illustrate how Templates include different fields and Slots.  The first diagram shows the fields and Slots on the Page Template. ","The next diagram shows the fields and Slots on the Snippet Template.","Notice that both Templates show the Display Title field, so it appears with the same text, About Enterprise Investments. The Slots on each formatted item include formatted portions of other content items. The Slots on the Page include multiple items while the Slot on the Snippet includes a single item. A Slot can include one or more items depending on how it is defined and how many items the person choosing to assemble it chooses to insert.","When you perform Active Assembly, you choose a Template to format a content item, and then insert or change Snippets included in its Slots. The Active Assembly Interface allows you to insert or change Snippets in Slots directly on the formatted content item.  In addition the Active Assembly Interface lets you edit data in fields on the main formatted content item or in Snippets in its Slots.","In the next topic we will begin to demonstrate how the Active Assembly Interface enables you to put together Web pages for your Site.","Note: For a more in depth explanation of Active Assembly, see the Active Assembly Tutorial accessible from the Help link at the top of the page.","Introduction to Active Assembly",
