<h2 class="heading2">Workflow Roles</h2>
<p class="bodytext">A Role defines a group of individuals that can act on content in a State. &nbsp;The Roles used in a workflow may not correspond to job titles in your company. &nbsp;For example, if you create a marketing workflow, you might create Roles with the names Copywriter, Editor, and Approver. &nbsp;The individuals assigned to the Copywriter Role may carry the job title Copywriter, and the individuals assigned the Editor Role may carry the job title Editor, but the individuals assigned to the Approver Role probably don't have the job title Approver. &nbsp;It is more likely that they carry a job title such as Manager or Director or Vice-President.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Roles allow you define groups that correspond to the needs of the workflow, rather than constraining the workflow to the structure of your organization.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You must define Roles before you can assign them to a State.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You should create separate Roles for Communities and Workflows.  You should not assign the Roles that you associate with Communities to Workflows, and you should not associate the Roles that you assign with Workflows to Communities.  This allows you to create parallel Workflows, or Workflows that that apply to Content in more than one Community.  To transition a Content Item, a user must be in a Role assigned to the Content Item's Community and in a Role assigned to the transition. </p>
