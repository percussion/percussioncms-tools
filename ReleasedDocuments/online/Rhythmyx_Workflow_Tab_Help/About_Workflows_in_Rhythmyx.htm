<h1 class="heading1">About Workflows in Rhythmyx</h1>
<p class="bodytext">A workflow is a business process that defines a sequence of events. &nbsp;Assign a workflow to a Rhythmyx application to define and control the sequence of events that occur in that application.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In Rhythmyx, a workflow consists of <a id="h987" class="jumptemplate" title="States" href="States.htm" target="_self">States</a> (steps in the workflow processing of a content item) and <a id="h1058" class="jumptemplate" title="Workflow Roles" href="Workflow_Roles.htm" target="_self">Roles</a> (groups of individuals who can act on content). &nbsp;Assign Roles to determine which users can take action on content in each State. &nbsp;Define Transitions to move content from one State to another.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you create content in a Rhythmyx application that is attached to a workflow, the content is automatically managed by the workflow. &nbsp;The content starts in an <em class="emphasis">Initial State</em>, which is the first State the content enters in the workflow. &nbsp;Most commonly, the Initial State is some form of draft state in which the creator actively edits the content. &nbsp;When the draft is complete, the creator initiates a <em class="emphasis">Transition</em> to a State, typically some form of approval State, in which a member of another Role reviews the content. &nbsp;Further Transitions may involve additional drafts and approvals. &nbsp;The exact pattern is defined by the combination of States, Roles, and Transitions in the workflow. Eventually, the content reaches a State where it is Publishable, meaning it is eligible to be processed by the Rhythmyx Publisher application, which delivers the final output of the content. &nbsp;</p>
