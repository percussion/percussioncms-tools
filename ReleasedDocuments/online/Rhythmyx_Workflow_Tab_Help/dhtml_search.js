Eventually, the content reaches a State where it is Publishable, meaning it is eligible to be processed by the Rhythmyx Publisher application, which delivers the final output of the content. &nbsp;","About Workflows in Rhythmyx",

","A Workflow can include multiple Public States, however, and each State may have its own Quick Edit Transition, because Transitions in different States can have the same Trigger.","Define a Transition from the Quick Edit State back to the Public State.  This Transition should have the sys_TouchParentItems in the Workflow Actions field of the Edit Transition Page to ensure that all related content items are updated with the changes made during Quick Edit.","The following graphic shows a portion of a State diagram of a Workflow in which Quick Edit has been implemented.  Note the Quick Edit State, the Quick Edit Transition to the State, and the Publish Transition back to Public.","If a Content Item is in a Quick Edit State:","Previewing should display the most recent Version of the Content Item.","The Content List application should direct the Rhythmyx Publisher to publish the Content Item's last public revision. If a Content Item is linked to a Related Content Item that is currently in a Quick Edit State, the Content List should direct the Rhythmyx Publisher to publish the link to the last public revision of the Related Content Item. See &quot;Mapping a Content List Resource&quot; in the CMS Online Help for more information.","See the reference topic &quot;$contextDependentRevision&quot; in the Rhythmyx Workbench online help for a description of the macro that determines the revision of the Content Item to return.","Implementing Quick Edit",

Page[69]=new Array("A Workflow Action is an automatic action that can be added to a Transition. &nbsp;Rhythmyx executes the Workflow Action when Transitioning a content item from one State to another. &nbsp;For example, when a content item is approved for Transition to a Public State, all other content items that refer to that item need to be &quot;touched&quot; so the Publisher will republish them with updated links. &nbsp;A Workflow Action could be developed and added to the Transition to touch all of the other content items to ensure that they will be updated.","A Workflow Action is an extension of the IPSExtension Java extension. &nbsp;Thus, a Workflow Action extension must follow all of the requirements of Rhythmyx extensions, including thread safety. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Workflow Action extension must include a performAction method and implement the IPSWorkflowAction interface. &nbsp;The performAction method has two inputs: &nbsp;the request context and an instance of IPSWorkFlowContext. &nbsp;The code of the performAction method defines the actual Workflow Action.","To make the Workflow Action extension available, you must register it in the Rhythmyx Server Administrator. &nbsp;When registering a Workflow Action extension, you must select com.percussion.extension.IPSWorkflowAction as the Supported Interface.","Workflow Actions",
