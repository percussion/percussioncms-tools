To demonstrate the process of choosing a Template for a Snippet, we will change the Template for 10 Mistakes You Can't Afford, the Snippet in the Sidebar Slot.","In order to see how the different Templates use different fields from the 10 Mistakes You Can't Afford content item, we will first open the content item so that we can view its fields as we look at its format using different Templates.

Notice that the Template selected under Select a Template and displayed under Template Preview are the same as the Template formatting the Snippet in the Slot. Differences in text and background color are due to formatting done on the page instead of the Template. Text placement is often specified on the page, as in this case, in which the Template centers the text but the page left-justifies it. Bolding, as in the display title, is usually specified in the Template.","Choose each of the Templates listed under Select a template and look at their previews under Template Preview.
