 A project known as Site Migration (see spec by Martin Genhart in spec db)
includes a client for scanning and analyzing a set of resources to convert
them to a set of Rx CMS items and then upload them to a Rhythmyx server.
 The model for performing all of these operations has many 'hooks' that allow
  different types of modules (commonly known as plugins) to be used. This 
  module has all those plugins.
