<h4 class="heading4">Roles</h4>
<p class="bodytext">A Role is a collection of users or groups of users. &nbsp;In Rhythmyx, Roles are used to manage access to specific applications and to manage access to content items in the Workflow.  Users must be assigned to at least one Role to be allowed to log in to Rhythmyx.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Access to applications is granted based on the Roles to which a user belongs. &nbsp;Organizing users into Roles helps you manage users that have the same permissions. &nbsp;Instead of managing the permissions for each user, you define a Role and the permissions for it, then assign users to it. &nbsp;Users assigned to that Role have the permissions specified for that Role. &nbsp;When you assign a Role to the Access Control List of an application, the users in that Role have access to that application.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In Workflow, Roles determine which users have access to a content item and can act on it when it is in a particular State. &nbsp;Roles also determine which users are notified when a content item makes a Transition into or out of a State.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Each Role, and each Member in a Role, has a set of properties. Properties are defined by the administrator to provide additional options for customization. &nbsp;For example, a Role might have the property sys_community.  The value of this property specifies the Community to which the members of the Role belong.  Rhythmyx uses this property to implement the Communities feature, filtering the content to which the user has access, the tabs on the Content Explorer that the user can see, and the Content Types and Templates or Variants available to the user.</p>
<p class="bodytext">To maintain Roles, use the Roles tab of the Security tab in the System Administrator. &nbsp;Two views are available. You can view a list of Roles and the Members associated with each Role (Members by Role) or you can view a list of Members and the Roles associated with each Member (Roles by Member). &nbsp;Select the option you want from the <strong class="specialbold">View</strong> field.</p>
