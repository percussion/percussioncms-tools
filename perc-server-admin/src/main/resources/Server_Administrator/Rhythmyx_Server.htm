<h1 class="heading1">Rhythmyx Server</h1>
<p class="bodytext">The Rhythmyx Server is a real-time data access server that facilitates delivering back-end data to the web. Unlike most data-to-web products that require and interpret scripts embedded in web pages at run time, Rhythmyx converts back-end data to web pages by letting you define visually how back-end data is converted to XML documents. Rhythmyx then lets you apply style sheets to format the output HTML page.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a browser makes a request (by means of a URL) that you've defined with Rhythmyx, the Rhythmyx server intercepts the request and processes it. Rhythmyx delivers any web pages as HTML or XML documents. All of these processes occur in real-time.</p>
<p class="bodytext">To return data to the user as web pages, Rhythmyx merges XML data with an XSL style sheet that Rhythmyx or the web designer created at design time. The style sheet holds all static formatting and static content, which is content that doesn't change at run time.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Rhythmyx server also provides security, connectivity, and session management.</p>
