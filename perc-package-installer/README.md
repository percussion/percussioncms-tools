# Package Installer
Package Installer allows for a Percussion CMS pakage (ppkg file) to be installed on a target server. 

Packages are generated and maintained by the Package Builder tool. 

This module is a lightweight wrapper that generates an executable jare file that can launch the Page Installer user interface.

Running:  

java -jar perc-package-installer-<version>.jar
