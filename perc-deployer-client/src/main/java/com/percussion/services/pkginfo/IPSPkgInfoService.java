/**
 * This is the primary interface for the Package Information Service. A Package
 * is a collection of design objects that make up an installable, configurable
 * "solution" such as a site, blog, rss feed,etc.
 * <p>
 * This service supports 3 objects:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Package Information (<code>PSPkgInfo</code>). There is one PkgInfo
 * object for each Solution created or installed on a server. </li>
 * <li> Package Element (<code>PSPkgElement</code>). Each design object
 * installed with a Package is tracked by a PkgInfo Element attached to the
 * PkgInfo object. </li>
 * <li> Package Element Dependency (<code>PSPkgElementDependency</code>).
 * Any external dependency of a Package is tracked by attaching a Package
 * Element Dependency object to the package (whether the dependency is present
 * on the server or not) </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Methods exist for each object, where the <code>XXX</code> represents the
 * different object names. There may be situations where certain of these
 * methods are not applicable, but that is expected to be rare.
 * </ul>
 * <li><code>createXXX</code></li>
 * <li><code>copyXXX</code></li>
 * <li><code>saveXXX</code></li>
 * <li><code>deleteXXX</code></li>
 * <li><code>findXXX</code></li>
 * <li><code>loadXXX</code></li>
 * <li><code>loadXXXModifiable</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <code>createXXX</code> methods should always be used to create new objects,
 * they should not be created directly, even if the type is known. Likewise for
 * <code>copyXXX</code>, <code>saveXXX</code>, <code>deleteXXX</code>.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * All <code>loadXXX</code> and <code>findXXX</code> methods work with
 * cached objects. Cached objects are shared and therefore must not be modified
 * by the caller. There is no enforcement of this rule. If an object needs to be
 * modified, the <code>loadXXXModifiable</code> method must be called instead.
 * This method is guaranteed to load the object from persistent storage each
 * time it is called.
 * <p>
 * There are 2 distinctions between the <code>loadXXX</code> and
 * <code>findXXX</code> methods. The first is that <code>loadXXX</code> will
 * throw an exception if valid objects can't be returned for each supplied key;
 * <code>findXXX</code> will return nothing or <code>null</code>, depending
 * on what was supplied. If keys were supplied, <code>null</code> will be
 * returned for each key that doesn't have a matching object. If filters are
 * supplied, only the matching objects are returned. The 2nd distinction is that
 * the <code>loadXXX</code> methods only take keys as arguments, never
 * filters. Here, 'key' means some property value meant to match exactly 1
 * object, e.g. a GUID or a name.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The Package (PkgInfo) object has a parent-child relationship with the its
 * Configuration, Dependency, and Element objects. The Package object supports
 * both a list of IDs and a list of the actual object. Each method defines
 * whether the children will be realized, but in general, read/only objects have
 * realized children and objects loaded for modification don't have realized
 * children (todo: grok this and implement).
 * <p>
 * Generally, service methods don't throw checked exceptions. However, they
 * should document the unchecked exceptions that they know they throw.
 *
