   When processing a business config (BC,) each property's name is normalized
   by prepending the surrounding SolutionConfigurations@publisherPrefix + the 
   surrounding solution's name, e.g. 
   com.percussion.RSS.stateTaxRates. This name must be unique across all 
   configurable properties.
   
   We support several types of data structure
      simple - name-value
      list of pairs - 0 or more pairs of data (map like)
      list - 0 or more values of the same type
      named group of properties (propertySet) (any of the above are allowed as children)
      associations - e.g. ctype->template

   Collections are generally managed as complete units in this release (with a
   few, rare exceptions.)
   
   If a default value is provided, but you want to clear it, you must use the
   element form. A missing attribute, or empty value is treated as no value and
   the default is used. However, an empty value element is treated as empty.
   
   There are 2 files: the defaults are stored in 1 file and the overrides are
   in a different file. The defaults are loaded first, then the BC configuration
   is loaded and overwrites the defaults where values are provided. The 
   SolutionConfigurations@type attribute specifies which type of file this is. 
   
   propertySet is a container for a set of properties that logically make up a
   single unit.
