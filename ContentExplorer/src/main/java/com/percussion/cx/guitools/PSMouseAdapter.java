 * This class is used to get around a bug/change introduced in Java 1.4.2_05
 * where clicking the mouse button when the control key is depressed will
 * no longer produce a "mouseClicked" event. This is a problem for Apple
 * Mac's as they use the control/click as Microsoft Windows uses a right-click.
 * 
 * You cannot implement the "mousePressed", "mouseReleased", or "mouseClicked"
 * methods when extending this class, but should instead implement
 * the "mouseWasPressed", "mouseWasReleased", or "mouseWasClicked" methods
