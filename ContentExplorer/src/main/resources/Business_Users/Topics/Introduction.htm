<p class="bodytext">Content management is the process of creating content, evaluating and approving it, merging it with formatting, and publishing it to a destination, such as a Web Site or a database (or using it in another format, such as a print document). Rhythmyx is a Content Management System that lets you complete these processes in an environment that you can customize to match your needs.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In Rhythmyx, content includes text, images, and any other files, such as Java applets or PDFs that may be included on a Web page. Content contributors create Content Items by entering content into Rhythmyx through Content Editors, or forms for entering data. Some Content Editors allow you to enter text into form fields, while other Content Editors permit you to upload content created in another tool, such as a word processor or a graphics editor. </p>
<p class="bodytext">In Rhythmyx, Content Items are the basic units for creating documents and Web pages.  Content Items are associated with various Templates,  which may include Slots for including other formatted Content Items. For example, a page Template for a  text Content Item could include a Slot for including a formatted image Content Item to produce a page that includes text and an illustration.  </p>
<p class="bodytext">After a Content Item is created in a Content Editor, it enters a Rhythmyx Workflow. A Workflow defines the editing and approval process for each Content Item. &nbsp;In a Workflow, each Content Item progresses through a series of States.  In each State certain user Roles may perform defined actions on the item. For example, the Author of a text item could transition it from a Draft to an Edit State, in which an Editor could proofread the item and review it for style. &nbsp;The Editor could approve it or send it back to the Author. Eventually, the Content Item reaches a Public State. In&nbsp;the Public State, the Content Item is eligible to be published. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Rhythmyx Content Assemblers assemble pages by formatting Content Items and inserting them into Slots on other formatted Content Items. This process is called &quot;rolling up&quot; content because  each formatted Content Item may be inserted into a Slot on another formatted Content Item, which in turn may be inserted into a Slot on another formatted Content Item, and so on. In this manner, Content Assemblers may combine any number of Content Items to create a page. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Content Assemblers can format the same basic Content Items in various ways and reuse them in any number of Slots on other Content Items. This allows the user to modify the information in a single Content Item, and automatically have the information updated everywhere it appears on a site.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Rhythmyx performs content assembly prior to publishing, so Web site creators can preview their site and modify the Content Items formatted with Templates and placed in Slots. During publishing, Rhythmyx selects Content Items from the Rhythmyx database that are eligible to be published, and assembles them as pages to the delivery system.</p>
